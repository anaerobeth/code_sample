# In 1910, the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan found several rapidly
# converging infinite series that can be used to generate a numerical
# approximation of pi. His series are now the basis for the fastest
# algorithms currently used to calculate Ï€.

# Below is an implementation in Ruby of a function called estimate_pi
# that uses his formula to compute and return an estimate of pi
# (an exercise from Chapter 7 of Think Python by Allen Downey).
